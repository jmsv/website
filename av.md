## Testimonials

**DurHack 2019**

> Will ran the A/V for our opening talks and helped bring a couple of great ideas about how to add polish and flair to bring energy to the room. He was able to adapt to our needs on-the-fly and keep transitions > smooth between speakers.
> 
> Will also did a fantastic job of running our finalist presentations entirely by himself. Having heard about his legendary(!) A/V skills at OxfordHack 2019, I had full faith that Will would pull through and keep our presentations seamless and on schedule – and he stepped up to the challenge and ran the presentations with no drama. I was able to step back and focus on other things while Will got teams quickly and effectively onboarded with the relevant A/V set up, and was able to professionally handle issues and special requirements. I would love to have Will at every event I'm at!

**ManMetHacks 2020**

> Will's constant devotion to our event and the AV solutions involved were far more than anyone could have expected 
> for a volunteer. He created animated assets that adhered to the branding guidelines and looked stunning and really added 
> to the experience of opening ceremony. He also helped form the basis of our opening and closing ceremony slides and made 
> doing finalist presentations a breeze due to picture-in-picture really helping for hardware hacks. 
>
> I first met Will at HackTheMidlands 4.0 and after seeing what an impressive job he and the rest of Levitation Events did 
> with the sound, lighting and visuals, I almost begged him to be a part of ManMetHacks. He was a perfect addition to the team > and the event couldn't have run smoother if we had tried thanks to his dedication and hard work.
