I love helping hackathons around the UK to provide the best experience to hackers. I love adding a professional touch to your opening/closing ceremony + demos, building hype among hackers, without making beginners etc, feel intimidated.

## Testimonials

**DurHack 2019**

> Will ran the A/V for our opening talks and helped bring a couple of great ideas about how to add polish and flair to bring energy to the room. He was able to adapt to our needs on-the-fly and keep transitions > smooth between speakers.
> 
> Will also did a fantastic job of running our finalist presentations entirely by himself. Having heard about his legendary(!) A/V skills at OxfordHack 2019, I had full faith that Will would pull through and keep our presentations seamless and on schedule – and he stepped up to the challenge and ran the presentations with no drama. I was able to step back and focus on other things while Will got teams quickly and effectively onboarded with the relevant A/V set up, and was able to professionally handle issues and special requirements. I would love to have Will at every event I'm at!
