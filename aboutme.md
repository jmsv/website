title: About me
---

I'm a Computer Science student studying at the University of Birmingham. 

Outside of my studies, I support student run hackathons all across the country.

Notable mentions:

- Organiser for HackTheMidlands 4.0
- Mentor, Judge, and responsible for the opening/closing ceremonies and presentations for DurHack 2019
- AV Partner for ManMetHacks 2.0

Along with that, I've created Hackathons for Schools Association, aimed at providing hackathons for 15-18 year olds.
