title: Display Dongles for Hackathon Demos
---

Here's a list of the inputs available for your demo:

- HDMI
- USB C
- VGA
- Mini DisplayPort
- DVI
- Micro HDMI

There is also a camera available for hardware hacks.

Every demo will get 3 minutes, which will be displayed on a screen in front of you. This will flash in the last 10 seconds of your demo, so you can wrap it up.
