title: How to run Hackathon Demos 101
---

Live demos can be quite time consuming. There's a lot of components to them, which if not organised properly can cause delays. 


## Overview

As a team is presenting, another team is already being prepped. This means the change over is very small (less than a minute). 

## Roles

There are quite a few key roles to make this run smoothly. These can sometimes be merged together, but if an issue occurs it will slow you down.

1. Announcements
2. A/V
3. Timings

### Announcements

Someone needs to have the running order (list of demos), and be ready to call them down on a microphone as soon as current team has finished and are starting to pick up their stuff.

### Audio / Visual (A/V)

Someone needs to find out what the team is actually demoing, every demo is different!

Find out what they would like to do, and tell them how you'll do it. This will be discussed in further detail in the "Components" section.

A/V can be as simple as connecting their laptop to the projector.

You can make your team change over smoother / more professional by using a production switcher, like [this](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/uk/products/atemmini), or capture card. This allows you to:
- Add background music
- Display something between demos (Event logo, or video)
- Switch between different video feeds quickly
- Picture in picture (useful for hardware hacks, or hacks that communicate between 2 devices)

If you want to make your demos more professional, look at how [I can help](/av)!

### Timings

Someone needs to be controlling the countdown for the team. 

This can be as simple as them having the countdown in front of them, and then notifying the team that they have finished.

It can also be controlling a digital countdown that is displayed in front of them. Examples of this include:

- Stage Countdown Timers (controlled with a remote)
- Hackathons Demo Countdown app (controlled via a web page)

It's important that the timings are sharp, as this can add a lot of delay to the schedule.

## Components

1. Getting the next team down
2. Prepping the next team
3. Connecting laptops / setting up cameras
4. Controlling the A/V
5. Controlling the countdown
6. Swapping the team fot the next team
